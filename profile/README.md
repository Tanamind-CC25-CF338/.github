# Tanamind - Created by CC25-CF338 Capstone Project Coding Camp by DBS Foundation 2025

Hello! 👋 Welcome to Tanamind, a smart farming assistant designed to help you grow plants efficiently using hydroponics — even in small spaces. With built-in machine learning, Tanamind can detect early signs of plant disease from leaf images and give you practical recommendations. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced grower, Tanamind is here to guide your hydroponic journey.

## 🛋️ Project Overview

Tanamind is a Hydroponic Guide Website designed to help farmers and individuals grow crops efficiently in limited spaces. Powered by Machine Learning, it allows users to upload leaf images for early disease detection and receive treatment recommendations. Tanamind offers step-by-step guidance on building hydroponic systems, a user-friendly interface, and supports smart, sustainable agriculture in Indonesia.

## 🪑 Why We Build This App

We built Tanamind out of concern for limited farming space in urban areas and the rising interest in home hydroponics. We noticed a lack of accessible digital guides and practical plant disease diagnosis tools. This inspired us to develop an app that combines hydroponic tutorials with machine learning-based disease detection, helping people farm more effectively in small spaces.

## 🦾 This is Our Team
